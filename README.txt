#Game created by Marlon Calvo
This is a game developed to help improve your mental calculations.

To play the game, you must provide a nickname (stores a save file with the name specified), 
number of questions to be prompted with, and the number of digits the operands contain.

You then have the option to choose what arithmetic challenge to continue with.
Random -- randomly selects any arithmetic operation for each question.

After you finish your session of questions, a score will be calculated.
The score is based on the speed of your answer, how many digits the operands had,
and the current consecutive numbers of correct answers for a given question.

You will be able to check your history after each session.
A drop down box is populated with all the sessions stored for the given nickname,
each will populate the table underneath with the questions you were prompted with
in that selected section.

A leaderboard has also been implemented for you and your friends :)
No duplicate entries for a given user, 
so please share this game with your friends ;)
